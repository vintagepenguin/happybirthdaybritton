						<h2>From: Nick Homer</h2>
						<p>One of the most blindingly brilliant things about Britton is that he gets things done.  He excellent at taking an awesome idea and actually making it happen.  To illustrate... 2 summers ago Britton and I are sitting on the grass in the park with a group of people talking about what we wanted to do that summer (or something like that).  Somewhere along the way, the idea of buying a motorhome for the sole purpose of road-tripping to canada came up. We were definitely both stoked about the idea, and started looking for motorhomes on KSL. </p>
						<p>Well... I took off the next day and spent the week in Portland for work, but about half way through my trip I got a text from Britton and Rico with our new motorhome parked out in front of our house.  That motorhome never made it to canada, but we put thousands of miles on that thing taking trips to moab, zions, idaho, fhe trips.  It also made an excellent go-kart trailer.  Everyone of those fun filled trips was made possible by Mr. Britton Kowalk.  He spent countless hours orchestrating trips, making sure people didn't starve, sending out immaculate packing lists, and making sure that the thing stayed in one piece.  </p>
						<p>
							Some of the best memories of my life were made in that motorhome, and I definitely owe it all to Mr. Britton Kowalk.  I bow to your excellence, thanks for everything.  Let it be noted that the motorhome is just one of MANY events/projects/parties in which Britton has been the key orchestrator.

						<h2>From: Jordan Mulford</h2>
						<p>Ahhh Britton Kowalk...one of God's greatest gifts to myself. The first thing I thought about Britton when I met him coming into this ward was.."this guy talks a big game..." He was always throwing crazy ideas out to the group....well I am here to testify that several motorhome trips, one midnight laser tag battle in Goblin Valley, and 3 mancathalons later that I am converted to Britton Kowalk. He is not merely a man of words...HE IS A MAN OF ACTION! I respect Britton because he is truly a man of his word. This past year and a little bit I can say Britton is a great friend and a man among boys. One of my favorite memories of Britton
						was definitely driving with him in Hawaii. Britton had upgraded one of our rental cars to a Mustang convertible and I loved watching Britton's face as he cruised around the island with the top down. Britton knows how to have fun and being around him is always fun! My life is better because I am friends with Britton.</p>
