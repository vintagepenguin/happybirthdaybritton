						<h2>From: Nick Homer</h2>
						<p>One of the most blindingly brilliant things about Britton is that he gets things done.  He excellent at taking an awesome idea and actually making it happen.  To illustrate... 2 summers ago Britton and I are sitting on the grass in the park with a group of people talking about what we wanted to do that summer (or something like that).  Somewhere along the way, the idea of buying a motorhome for the sole purpose of road-tripping to canada came up. We were definitely both stoked about the idea, and started looking for motorhomes on KSL. </p>
						<p>Well... I took off the next day and spent the week in Portland for work, but about half way through my trip I got a text from Britton and Rico with our new motorhome parked out in front of our house.  That motorhome never made it to canada, but we put thousands of miles on that thing taking trips to moab, zions, idaho, fhe trips.  It also made an excellent go-kart trailer.  Everyone of those fun filled trips was made possible by Mr. Britton Kowalk.  He spent countless hours orchestrating trips, making sure people didn't starve, sending out immaculate packing lists, and making sure that the thing stayed in one piece.  </p>
						<p>
							Some of the best memories of my life were made in that motorhome, and I definitely owe it all to Mr. Britton Kowalk.  I bow to your excellence, thanks for everything.  Let it be noted that the motorhome is just one of MANY events/projects/parties in which Britton has been the key orchestrator.

						<h2>From: Jordan Mulford</h2>
						<p>Ahhh Britton Kowalk...one of God's greatest gifts to myself. The first thing I thought about Britton when I met him coming into this ward was.."this guy talks a big game..." He was always throwing crazy ideas out to the group....well I am here to testify that several motorhome trips, one midnight laser tag battle in Goblin Valley, and 3 mancathalons later that I am converted to Britton Kowalk. He is not merely a man of words...HE IS A MAN OF ACTION! I respect Britton because he is truly a man of his word. This past year and a little bit I can say Britton is a great friend and a man among boys. One of my favorite memories of Britton
						was definitely driving with him in Hawaii. Britton had upgraded one of our rental cars to a Mustang convertible and I loved watching Britton's face as he cruised around the island with the top down. Britton knows how to have fun and being around him is always fun! My life is better because I am friends with Britton.</p>

						<h2>From: Tim Hope</h2>
						<p>During a recent conversation with a friend of mine, the topic of my quality Instagrams came up.  My response to said friend did not elaborate on my photography or Snapseed skills, but rather was this: "I landed in a goldmine of roommates."  I had the best summer of my life this last year and nearly all positive experiences can traced back to Britton Kowalk.  Upon further review of my Instagrams, 90% of the photos were taken during events planned by Britton.</p>
						<p>Britton is a man of action.  When a good idea is thrown on the table, Britton is the catalyst to make sure it happens when most others just think about how fun it would be.  From orchestrating an epic laser tag battle in Goblin Valley to framing blown up panorama photos of our adventures to be mounted on our wall, Britton gets it done.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aside from all the adventure stuff, Britton could not be a better roommate to ask for.  We pretend we are annoyed by his OCD tidiness, but are actually thrilled to have someone keep our living space well kept.  He offers his services unceasingly and is inclusive of anyone who wishes to join the fun.
						</p>
						<p>
							I can honestly say the best two years of my life started when Britton became my roommate and friend.  And that's no coincidence, his friendship has played a major role in my enjoyment of life.

						<h2>From: Ryan Jones</h2>
						<p>I first met Britton Kowalk on August 26, 2012 after church as we were entering out apartments.  Little did I know that I was meeting one of the most influential people of my life--particularly in teaching me of what fun is as well as how productive a person can be.</p>
						<p>Britton is the antithesis of procrastination and boredom.  He can't not do something that is fun and get it set up right away.  As others mention, you can hardly find anything you did "fun" that didn't have Britton spearheading it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Britton became known to me as The Maestro after organizing what I would call "a symphony of a party" on December 11, 2012.  It was one of the most unique parties I've ever been to that changed the theme of what was being celebrated with every swing of his arm.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although Britton is The Headmaster of Fun, I appreciate Britton's friendship for much more.  I've never met such an intelligent person that can be so easily amused by kitten posts.  His easy sense of humor that takes intelligence, spontaneity, and taking odd things literally makes life enjoyable to be around.  I find myself often posting things on his wall as I am confident that he will genuinely appreciate such things.
						</p>
						<p>
						It is as difficult for me to meet people and tell them about my life without mentioning "my neighbor Britton."  I can honestly say I feel privileged to know Britton Kowalk and to be within his frequent associations.  Love you Britton.

						<h2>From: Levi Rasmussen</h2>
						<p>Britton is not only a maestro of events, he's also a magician and high ranking mage of wisdom, a well of pure life knowledge. One of the greatest moments I ever had with Britton was when I asked him to share his wisdom and brilliance about how he is able to be so productive.  He counseled me thoroughly but simply by saying, "I'm just pissed off that I have stuff to do.  I love having nothing to do and I hate having things to do.  So I just started doing everything a day early or two days early.  It's Reverse Laziness. I was addicted to having nothing to do, so I did everything right away."  Reverse Laziness is his motive for being so awesome.</p>
						<p>I also love his subtle but genuine laugh that frequents and blesses the ear drums of all in his presence.  His way with words is unmatched by man or woman in this realm of existence.  His facial hair is various and delightful.  His compliments are penetrating and uplifting to the Nth degree.  I consider his statement, "Snapchat should be banned from everyone, except Levi, he's the only one that should be allowed to have Snapchat." as the greatest compliment I have ever received in the entirety of my life.</p>
						<p>I'm almost certain that North and South Korea would be reunited with just one genius-ly planned party by the Maestro of Festivities. To witness a beautifully performed monologue by the incomparable Britton Kowalk, is to be graced by an orchestra of fierce emotion, power, and inspiration.  But overall, he's an amazing friend, gentleman, comrade, brother, and man.</p>
