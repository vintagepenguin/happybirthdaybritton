						<h2>From: Nick Homer</h2>
						<p>One of the most blindingly brilliant things about Britton is that he gets things done.  He excellent at taking an awesome idea and actually making it happen.  To illustrate... 2 summers ago Britton and I are sitting on the grass in the park with a group of people talking about what we wanted to do that summer (or something like that).  Somewhere along the way, the idea of buying a motorhome for the sole purpose of road-tripping to canada came up. We were definitely both stoked about the idea, and started looking for motorhomes on KSL. </p>
						<p>Well... I took off the next day and spent the week in Portland for work, but about half way through my trip I got a text from Britton and Rico with our new motorhome parked out in front of our house.  That motorhome never made it to canada, but we put thousands of miles on that thing taking trips to moab, zions, idaho, fhe trips.  It also made an excellent go-kart trailer.  Everyone of those fun filled trips was made possible by Mr. Britton Kowalk.  He spent countless hours orchestrating trips, making sure people didn't starve, sending out immaculate packing lists, and making sure that the thing stayed in one piece.  </p>
						<p>
							Some of the best memories of my life were made in that motorhome, and I definitely owe it all to Mr. Britton Kowalk.  I bow to your excellence, thanks for everything.  Let it be noted that the motorhome is just one of MANY events/projects/parties in which Britton has been the key orchestrator.

						<h2>From: Jordan Mulford</h2>
						<p>Ahhh Britton Kowalk...one of God's greatest gifts to myself. The first thing I thought about Britton when I met him coming into this ward was.."this guy talks a big game..." He was always throwing crazy ideas out to the group....well I am here to testify that several motorhome trips, one midnight laser tag battle in Goblin Valley, and 3 mancathalons later that I am converted to Britton Kowalk. He is not merely a man of words...HE IS A MAN OF ACTION! I respect Britton because he is truly a man of his word. This past year and a little bit I can say Britton is a great friend and a man among boys. One of my favorite memories of Britton
						was definitely driving with him in Hawaii. Britton had upgraded one of our rental cars to a Mustang convertible and I loved watching Britton's face as he cruised around the island with the top down. Britton knows how to have fun and being around him is always fun! My life is better because I am friends with Britton.</p>

						<h2>From: Lani Kowalk (Britton's Mom :)</h2>
						<p>There's plenty I could say, but I think I'll keep it simple. Besides, I think he likes it better when I don't share all the embarrassing reasons why I adore him. I'll just say I've loved him longer and much more than anyone else possibly could. I'm so thankful to be his mom! <br>
						I love you, Britton! <br>
						Happy Birthday!!! <br> </p>

						<h2>From: Tim Hope</h2>
						<p>During a recent conversation with a friend of mine, the topic of my quality Instagrams came up.  My response to said friend did not elaborate on my photography or Snapseed skills, but rather was this: "I landed in a goldmine of roommates."  I had the best summer of my life this last year and nearly all positive experiences can traced back to Britton Kowalk.  Upon further review of my Instagrams, 90% of the photos were taken during events planned by Britton.</p>
						<p>Britton is a man of action.  When a good idea is thrown on the table, Britton is the catalyst to make sure it happens when most others just think about how fun it would be.  From orchestrating an epic laser tag battle in Goblin Valley to framing blown up panorama photos of our adventures to be mounted on our wall, Britton gets it done.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aside from all the adventure stuff, Britton could not be a better roommate to ask for.  We pretend we are annoyed by his OCD tidiness, but are actually thrilled to have someone keep our living space well kept.  He offers his services unceasingly and is inclusive of anyone who wishes to join the fun.
						</p>
						<p>
							I can honestly say the best two years of my life started when Britton became my roommate and friend.  And that's no coincidence, his friendship has played a major role in my enjoyment of life.

						<h2>From: Ryan Jones</h2>
						<p>I first met Britton Kowalk on August 26, 2012 after church as we were entering out apartments.  Little did I know that I was meeting one of the most influential people of my life--particularly in teaching me of what fun is as well as how productive a person can be.</p>
						<p>Britton is the antithesis of procrastination and boredom.  He can't not do something that is fun and get it set up right away.  As others mention, you can hardly find anything you did "fun" that didn't have Britton spearheading it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Britton became known to me as The Maestro after organizing what I would call "a symphony of a party" on December 11, 2012.  It was one of the most unique parties I've ever been to that changed the theme of what was being celebrated with every swing of his arm.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although Britton is The Headmaster of Fun, I appreciate Britton's friendship for much more.  I've never met such an intelligent person that can be so easily amused by kitten posts.  His easy sense of humor that takes intelligence, spontaneity, and taking odd things literally makes life enjoyable to be around.  I find myself often posting things on his wall as I am confident that he will genuinely appreciate such things.
						</p>
						<p>
						It is as difficult for me to meet people and tell them about my life without mentioning "my neighbor Britton."  I can honestly say I feel privileged to know Britton Kowalk and to be within his frequent associations.  Love you Britton.

						<h2>From: Levi Rasmussen</h2>
						<p>Britton is not only a maestro of events, he's also a magician and high ranking mage of wisdom, a well of pure life knowledge. One of the greatest moments I ever had with Britton was when I asked him to share his wisdom and brilliance about how he is able to be so productive.  He counseled me thoroughly but simply by saying, "I'm just pissed off that I have stuff to do.  I love having nothing to do and I hate having things to do.  So I just started doing everything a day early or two days early.  It's Reverse Laziness. I was addicted to having nothing to do, so I did everything right away."  Reverse Laziness is his motive for being so awesome.</p>
						<p>I also love his subtle but genuine laugh that frequents and blesses the ear drums of all in his presence.  His way with words is unmatched by man or woman in this realm of existence.  His facial hair is various and delightful.  His compliments are penetrating and uplifting to the Nth degree.  I consider his statement, "Snapchat should be banned from everyone, except Levi, he's the only one that should be allowed to have Snapchat." as the greatest compliment I have ever received in the entirety of my life.</p>
						<p>I'm almost certain that North and South Korea would be reunited with just one genius-ly planned party by the Maestro of Festivities. To witness a beautifully performed monologue by the incomparable Britton Kowalk, is to be graced by an orchestra of fierce emotion, power, and inspiration.  But overall, he's an amazing friend, gentleman, comrade, brother, and man.</p>

						<h2>From: Josef Kujanpaa</h2>
						<p>
							Dearest Britton, for your birthday bash, <br>
							Since meeting back then, times gone in a flash, <br>
							We've had a laugh or two here and there, <br>
							And quite literally, just about everywhere! <br>
							Your genius is great and I admire your passion, <br>
							Though red sweaters perhaps are not your fashion. <br>
							<br>
							We've laid nigh naked in the snow, <br>
							climbed China's Great Wall, <br>
							Even gone Nerf war ballistic in a big BYU hall. <br> <br>
							Many experiences and memories with you included, <br>
							You're one of the best, even the Manliest, I've concluded. <br> <br>
							So here on this day, for your birthday surprise, <br>
							This poem I send, with a bag of french fries (cue friends on same continent) <br>
							I wish you the bestest most happiest day, <br>
							And dream of our next adventure in May! (...just a thought) <br> <br>
							Happy Birthday Britton! <br> <br>
							Love, <br>
							Josef <br>

						<h2>From: Josh Dance</h2>
						<p>
						I knew that Britton was a special man, in all the manliest most gentlemanly ways, when he organized a little trip to Goblin Valley. The itinerary was flawless, the excitement huge.  His group messages we on time, and funny. It made you want to go. The day came and it went without a hitch. Amazing entertainment, execution and timing the army would have been proud of.  We went lazer tagging in Goblin Valley. Don't tell me how, it came about by the sheer force of Brittons will. The entire weekend, all 40 people, all the events, all the fun, all the memories, came about because of one man. The Man. Britton.

						<h2>From: Toby Parker</h2>
						<p>
							Am I lucky that I happened to move next door to Britton Kowalk 15 months ago? No, I’m blessed. A straight-up blessing from God is the only way to describe such a life altering event. Since becoming good friends with Britton, I have participated in more events that can be described as “outright fun” in one year, than I have in the last ten years. And that is 100% thanks to him. I’ve gone on numerous vacations and consider myself a better man just knowing him.  I’ve gone to Britton for advice countless times and received nothing but the best one could receive. I didn’t become friends with an intellectual genius with a Master’s Degree who happens to be a top dog at Adobe (nbd), I became friends with a magician, a Tesla.  The Most Interesting Man in the World doesn’t have Britton’s number on speed dial for fear of disappointing Britton for his lack of creativity and imagination. <br>
										<br>
							Ode to the Maestro <br>
 											<br>
							Words cannot describe <br>
							the Intellect of one mere man, <br>
							But we shall surely try <br>
							Let’s face it – we’re all his #1 fan. <br>
							 <br>
							His name is Britton Kowalk <br>
							A fountain of knowledge for many things, <br>
							One can always go to him for guidance <br>
							Pure wisdom is what he brings. <br>
							 <br>
							Today he turns 28 <br>
							Ten years since finishing high school, <br>
							A decade has proved one thing <br>
							He was the greatest in the gene pool. <br>
							 <br>
							Events, Parties, experiences <br>
							Among the finest in the land, <br>
							When you see Britton’s skills at planning <br>
							You’re just not worthy to shake his hand. <br>
							 <br>
							There’s a party going on tonight <br>
							I’d rather just stay in, <br>
							Wait…Britton planned the party? <br>
							Forget it – I’m going! Not going would be a sin. <br>
							 <br>
							When one becomes good friends <br>
							With Britton Kowalk, famous to all, <br>
							Life starts to truly begin <br>
							You wake up happy, tallest among the tall. <br>
							 <br>
							So let us honor this man <br>
							Raise your glass, buckle up, let’s go, <br>
							Let us all be grateful on this day <br>
							That we’re honoring the greatest man we know.<br>

						<h2>From: Chad Waite </h2>
						<p>
						"A couple weeks after returning from his mission, Britton and I watched an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. At one point during the obscure old movie, a soldier salutes his officer by raising his hand in a salute position....only midway up his chest and not his head. One of the MST3000 commentators made the quick comment "salute higher, dummy", which apparently to Britton and I was about the funniest thing we had heard up to that point in our lives as indicated by the five solid minutes of laughing that immediately followed. Britton's ability to appreciate random and often nonsensical humor is, in my mind, a quality that outweighs almost any other element of his personality and is most certainly why he was hired on at Adobe. Also I can't think of any grown adult who quotes Homestar Runner as much as him."

Britton is a total stud-muffin who brings joy and joyfullness to everyone around him. <br>

							Dearest Britton. Brittron. Britonamnoimnunia!!!! <br>
							Today is your birthday. You are reading this and many many other posts about how freakin' awesome you are. I am going to give you the greatest gift of all: the gift of humility. Now here is the part where I just tear into you… crap. I just can’t do it. You are just that awesome. Dare I say FREAKIN' awesome? I dare. <br>
							Remember when you were the only person I knew during B lunch the first year of high school? Or when we used to play Half-life in your basement against each other? Or laugh-cried our way through Invader Zim or Celebrity Jeopardy? Or before we could drive, your mom dropped us off at the theaters to watch The Lord Of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring for the first time? Remember Lewis and Clark? Or when we created the best cinematic feature of all time: The Claw instead of studying for the AP World History exam? Or when you were a month late trying out for the lacrosse team? Or when we went to Boulder City for the first time and it blew our minds? Or when we roomed together freshman year in the dorms, fought over the same girl, then got over it? When we both went on our missions to the North East and shared our experiences together? Or when created the most amazing band of all time and rocked girls’ faces off? Or when we went on the craziest of fun trips to all over and even a non-homosexual cruise to Mexico? <br>
							I am supposed to share a story, but there are just too many. Seriously, way too many. Can I share a picture? Yeah, I’ll do that. Happy Birthday buddy

						<h2>From: Alexa Justesen </h2>

							An ode to Mr. B. Kowalk <br>

							There's no one on earth like a Britton, <br>
							The day that we met I was smitten. <br>
							His luscious blond hair <br>
							The sense of humor that's rare, <br>
							and the body that won't soon be quittin'. <br>
																												<br>
							We went on a Christmas-y date <br>
							To see MoTab, and it was great. <br>
							He picked me up at my place, <br>
							We drove up with Radical Face, <br>
							And we got there, a little bit late. <br>

							Next up came Vegas and Bond, <br>
							And warm weather, of which I was fond. <br>
							We ran 'round the strip, <br>
							in the street I did trip <br>
							He stole our hearts in the suit that he donned. <br> <br>

							The scooter rides brought so much fun, <br>
							I fought for some rides and I won. <br>
							And then he moved out, <br>
							With a cry we did shout, <br>
							And we missed him, like, a ton. <br> <br>

							In the Spring we went to see Coldplay, <br>
							The best week of my life, I will say. <br>
							We played in the sand <br>
							And worshipped a band <br>
							All in all, it was a heyday. <br> <br>

							So Britton, on this day of your birth, <br>
							I hope you realize your worth. <br>
							You're special, it's true <br>
							A solid guy, through and through, <br>
							I hope this year brings you laughter and mirth. <br> <br>

							Happy birthday! Thanks for so many great memories the past three years! It's been a treat to have you in my life. :)

						<h2>From: Amber Crofts </h2>
						<p>
							My absolute favorite memory of Britton is when I got to be apart of the Summer Mancathalon by taking pictures. The event was so well organized and such a perfect summer night. The best part was the monologues, and Britton's was quite brilliant. By the end of his monologue he had everyone off the seat and ready to battle whatever came. I will include my favorite picture of this moment because Britton's face is absolutely priceless and encompasses how much fun the mancathalon was and how fun Britton is. Britton honestly is one of the kindest, nicest, most fun guys I have ever met. He can make anything into party; literally. If Britton is there you know that you will leave with a wonderful memory.

						Britton, Britton is the earliest summary of the law of England in the French tongue, which purports to have been written by command of King Edward I. <br>
						Britton you are truly of a noble origin, a man with the caliber of class as cumulative as yours could communicate cases combative of curiosity at its calmest collective combination of clout. <br>
						You are the colossus of clout. The king of clash. A caper of kings.But seriously, your generosity, positivity, kindness, and creativity seems to know no bounds. Thank you for you friendship and awesomeness!

							Britton! <br>
By now, you’ve received my “HAPPPPPPPPPPPPYYYYYYYYY!”, but something tells me that you may deserve just a little more than that!   I imagine everyone else has the whole “funny/memorable stories” involving Britton thing covered, so maybe I’ll get a little more gushy.
Britton, you’re one of the few people in life that I feel totally comfortable calling a “best friend”.  I don’t toss around that term lightly - you know I try really hard to be deliberate with what I say - so, you know this is a big deal!  But you deserve it.  Seriously.  A lot of what people are writing on this site, on your wall, in text messages, etc. today is likely to be really funny, and just plain fun.  And that’s a good thing! <br>
But, I wanted to let you know that you’re much more than someone who plans fun things.  You’re much more than someone who knows how to take a boring afternoon and fill it with laughter.  Beyond that, you’re a capable, kind, considerate, and generally FANTASTIC person who blesses all of our lives beyond understanding.  You are a hard-working, intelligent, and thoughtful person.  You have clearly been granted many great gifts, and you don’t squander them.  You use them effectively to bless others lives; to entertain, to cheer, to uplift, to comfort, to teach, to generally rock the socks off of Life itself! <br>
Having known you for as long and as well as I have, I’ve come to know that you place great value and importance upon being a good person, and on being a good man specifically.  Britton, you’re even more than that.  You are a great man.  Thank you for being such a solid friend, example, priesthood holder, advisor, etc.  You may never appreciate the positive way in which you’ve influenced all of our lives!  I know that I am certainly a better person because of your friendship and example. <br>
Thanks for being such an incredible person, my friend, and I hope this is one of your best birthdays yet!  Now, let’s go build a treehouse or something! <br>

							Britton has always been the guy to go to for anything that required a smarty pants. He helped me make my first ebay purchase (laser pointer for $8...the thing you had to have in middle school to be borderline rebel and pretty cool). Britton also enthusiastically helped inspire and set up the largest tower of groundbloom fire flower fireworks I've ever seen (but the record could now be easily broken since we have jobs and money to buy more). We stacked 40+ in 3 layered circle on top of each other and then put a lighted paper towel in the middle to light them all at the same time. Luckily, we had the hose with a power sprayer ready because the bottom level and top level ignited at the same time, causing the top level to launch straight upward. They ended up flying through the air in all different directions, including at the neighbors house and near the parked cars. Britton, in charge of the garden hose sprayer, was shooting water in all directions trying to extinguish the projectile fire hazards. And, thus was born my most exciting groundbloom flower experience to date. For the record, no fire damage was done to any property or people (or animals). <br>
							Britton's smart, sincere, helpful, and just an all-around good guy! Attack life creatively, with gusto, and always with the confidence something can indeed be done. That's Britton. Every 25 minute go-ped ride to his house growing up was worth it. Great friend!! <br>
